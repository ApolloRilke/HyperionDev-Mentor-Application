Positive aspects of the submission:
Thank you for the submission, StudentName. This was a great attempt. However, there are just a few aspects that we should address before the task can be marked complete.

Aspects of the submission that could be improved
The program currently has an "IndentationError: expected an indented block" error on line 2. Everything within the function groupAnagrams needs to be indented accordingly, a code block begins with indentation and terminates with the first unindented line.

The sorted function is missing an argument. Here is a link on how to use the sorted() function in Python: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-sorted-function/

More generally, your code has no comments. Comments should be added to every piece of code you write to explain what your code is doing. This will help anybody who reads your code better understand your logic, as well as a helpful reminder to yourself when returning to the code at a later stage. Additionally, commenting can help solidify your understanding of the concepts even more. 

Your variable names can be more descriptive. Please try to avoid single character variable names (even in loops), as they reduce the readability of your code. Here is a link to help guide you in naming conventions for Python: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles

Overall feedback:
Overall great attempt! Please fix these points mentioned and I will definitely take another look.
