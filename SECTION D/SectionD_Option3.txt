Explore setting up a feedback-review session with the student to explain the feedback and action points to better understand the opportunities for improvement that specifically apply to their submission, indicating to the student how these mentioned steps will lead to an improved understanding/outcome. This session will allow myself to also better understand what nature or level of feedback the student would prefer going forward should they still feel similarly after this check in session. This will better improve the student-mentor relationship going forward better understand one another.
If the social media post is defamatory or goes against student code of conduct, the matter should be reported to superiors/faculty. The negative review should be reported to faculty for guidance on how to handle the situation given the severity of the complaint. 

The student is irate and must be approached with a level head and calm manner to diffuse the situation. Some students become frustrated in their learning journey at some point, often times looking to lash out or blame the very support that is trying to help them. The support (ie, myself) in this case should reaffirm themselves to be unperturbed in providing quality support, especially to the student in question at a time like this. Taking criticism and interpreting feedback on one's work is part of the learning experience and is a vital skill to have in industry, and this should be treated as just another opportunity to guide/lead the student to appropriate ways on how to act an approach the situation in future in a job position. This is with the assumption that my own feedback was in fact non-generic, personalised, and actionable - this is also a good time to take stock and be reminded to continue to provide high quality feedback to students such that aiming to receive more positive reviews than rare negative reviews.
